Adds a title to an image using The Renegade Coder Featured Image style. The style can be
defined as the following:

> Titles are split in half by the closest space and displayed using two solid red bars
> with a white text overlay on the upper right portion of the image.

For example:

![Hello World in Pascal](https://i0.wp.com/therenegadecoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/hello-world-in-pascal-featured-image.jpeg?resize=1024%2C640&ssl=1)

## How to run

`pip install image-titler`

`image_titler -t title -p ./path_to_image -o ./output`
