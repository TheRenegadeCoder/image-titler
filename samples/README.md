# Sample Image Titles

In this archive, I'll share a series of samples that are output by this program.

## Default Behavior

The following image is an example of the default behavior of this program as of v1.8.0:

![3 Ways to map Two Lists to a Dict in Python](3-ways-to-map-two-lists-to-a-dict-in-python-featured-image-v1-8-0.JPEG)

Here's the command that would generate this image:

```shell script
image-titler
```

## Logo Behavior

The following image is an example of the behavior when the script is provided a logo:

![23 Tech Topics to Tackle](23-tech-topics-to-tackle-featured-image-v1-8-0.JPEG)

When using a logo, title background color is generated automatically. Here's another example:

![Hello World in MATLAB](hello-world-in-matlab-featured-image-v1-8-0.JPEG)

Here's the command that would generate these images:

```shell script
image-titler -l "path/to/logo"
```
