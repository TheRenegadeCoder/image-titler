In this archive, I'll share a series of samples that are output by this program. That said,
here's a quick video overview:

## Default Behavior

The following image is an example of the default behavior of this program as of 2.2.0:

![Welcome to the Image Titler by The Renegade Coder](v2.2.0/welcome-to-the-image-titler-by-the-renegade-coder-v2-2-0.jpg)

Here's the command that would generate this image:

```shell script
image-titler
```

## Logo Behavior

The following image is an example of the behavior when the script is provided a logo as of 1.8.0:

![23 Tech Topics to Tackle](v2.2.0/23-tech-topics-to-tackle-v2-2-0.jpg)

When using a logo, title background color is generated automatically. Here's another example:

![Hello World in MATLAB](v2.2.0/hello-world-in-matlab-v2-2-0.jpg)

Here's the command that would generate these images:

```shell script
image-titler -l "path/to/logo" -p "path/to/image"
```

## Tier Behavior

The following image is an example of the behavior when the premium subscription tier is applied to the logo as of 1.8.0:

![The Guide to Causing Mass Panic](v2.2.0/the-guide-to-causing-mass-panic-v2-2-0.jpg)

To generate an image like this, use the following command:

```shell script
image-titler -r premium -p "path/to/image"
```

In addition, the script supports a free tier as well:

![Columbus Drivers Are Among the Worst](v2.2.0/columbus-drivers-are-among-the-worst-v2-2-0.jpg)

To generate an image like this, use the following command:

```shell script
image-titler -r free -p "path/to/image"
```

## Custom Font Behavior

In v2.1.0, we introduced custom font support:

![Reflecting on My Third Semester of Teaching](v2.2.0/reflecting-on-my-third-semester-of-teaching-v2-2-0.jpg)

To generate an image like this, use the following command:

```shell script
image-titler -f "arial.ttf" -p "path/to/image"
```

## Custom Size Behavior

In v2.3.0, we introduced custom size support. For example, the following image was
generated in the YouTube size (1280, 720):

![The Art of Simplification](v2.3.0/the-art-of-simplification-v2-3-0.jpg)

To generate an image like this, use the following command:

```shell
image-titler -s YouTube -p "path/to/image"
```
